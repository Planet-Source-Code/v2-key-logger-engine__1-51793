Description: 	Key Logger Engine Is A Unique DLL File For Capturing Keystrokes And Logging Them Into File In 
		Encrypted Form. This Engine Also Support MultiMode Which Means You Can Specify The Application
		For Which The Key Strokes Should Be Logged This Can Be Done By Specifying Class Name To Log Or
		Application's Window Text. First The Idea Of A KeyLogger Came Into My Mind When I Saw Few Basic
		Key Loggers And Other Some Tools That Only Boast About Their Works But Do Simply Nothing Or Need
		Very Complicated Procedures And Even After That Does not Give The Desired Result, But With The Help
		Of This DLL One Can Capture Keystrokes With Very Few Line Of Codes As You Need Not To Write A Single
		Line Of Code For Capturing The Keystrokes. This KeyLogger Can Capture All The 255 Virtual Keys Or 
		In Simple Words I Can Say It Can Capture Any Modern Keyboard Including Windows Key,Context Menu Key,
		All Function Keys And Also Toggle Keys With Their Status Such As Caps Lock,Num Lock And All Other.
		Well This Was Just A Short Description Of The Features Of This Unique Tool. Hope You Find It Useful.
